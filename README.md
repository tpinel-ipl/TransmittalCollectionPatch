# TransmittalCollectionPatch

This patch will take version specific objects found within a Collection and add them to a Transmittal.  Currently the CORE code only adds the most recent version of an object from a Collection to a Transmittal.

This functionality should be added to CORE in the next release.  Once this functionality is in CORE, this patch should be removed.
